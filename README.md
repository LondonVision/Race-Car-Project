# Race-Car-Project
The user can buy a car object and then use that car to race to try and earn money. The car has its own rating based on how good all of its parts are which in turn, contributes to how well it performs in races. This shows my use of subclasses, object oriented programming, and implementing an interface. 
You cannot race without purchsing a car first. 
You also have to input a valid age that could have a license (16).
You can also access the dealership's data by entering the password (password123) and see the past sales that it has made.
Every event such as a sale or race has a time stamp so you can see exactly when that occured.
Price is also dependent on how "good" the car is as calculated by the score of the parts.
